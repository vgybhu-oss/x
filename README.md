<i>The big question I have lately is... "Is any of this worth it?"</i>
Please contact me in person to tell me directly if you think it was or is.<p></p>
Also, I believe that I will feel more valued if I am paid directly here:

The thing is, if I don't start feeling valued, then I am likely to start valuing you all a lot less.

Please assist before it is too late.
